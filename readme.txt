If you are an iOS app developer with a Wordpress marketing site for your mobile app, you've experienced the hassle of copying/pasting reviews from the iOS App Store onto your site. 

**Ratings and reviews give your app the social proof that it needs to convince others to download it**, so it's critical to show them on your marketing web site as well. Stop the madness of finding, copying, and pasting reviews from the App Store onto your site - let the App Reviews plugin automatically display the latest reviews for you. **5 minute setup, no maintenance required.**

The App Reviews plugin gives you a shortcode to put to use on your Wordpress marketing site. All you have to do is put in the app id from the iOS App Store, and the plugin will do the rest. A flexible, responsive carousel will display on your site and show off your app's ratings and reviews to everyone who comes to your site.

_Never copy and paste reviews from the App Store again with the App Reviews plugin!_
